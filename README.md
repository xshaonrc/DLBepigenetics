## Abstract  

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia with known genetic and environmental interaction. However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms which reflect these gene-environment interactions are poorly studied.  

Herein, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of post-mortem brain tissue from pathologically confirmed DLB cases and compared these with cognitively normal control subjects. We identified 296 significantly differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and 215 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the groups. The DMCs are enriched in the CpG islands and Bivalent enhancers. Furthermore, functional enrichment analysis showed that the genes associated with the DMRs are enriched in the biological process of “Memory”, and diseases of “Memory impairment” and “Delirium”. In addition, weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that DNA methylation at different genomic locations (of different genes) could have been co-regulated in association with DLB. Some of these co-regulated modules, for example the black module in this study, showed enrichment in the biological process of neuron projection morphogenesis and demonstrated significant association with Intelligence related diseases. 

Overall, our study uncovers novel, previously unreported DMCs associated with DLB offering new insights into its pathogenesis. There is a possibility that some of these could be applied as DLB biomarkers which remains to be explored.
